Uses the browse_win module (assuming it's a custom module) to open a file browser for selection.
Prints the full path of the selected file.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
browse_win module (details required on its implementation)

Usage:
use "pip install Browse-win==0.0.1" or visit "https://pypi.org/project/Browse-win/0.0.1/"
Save the script as file_uploader.py.
Run the script: python file_uploader.py.
Type "File" and press Enter when prompted.

Additional Notes:

This script is a basic example and can be further enhanced with features like error handling, validation, and progress bar.
The browse_win module is not a standard library module. Please provide details on its implementation or consider using a built-in module like tkinter or PyQt for cross-platform compatibility.
If you plan to distribute this script, consider packaging it with the necessary dependencies.
